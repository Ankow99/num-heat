# numerical-heat-conduction
A numerical simulation of heat conduction using the Crank-Nicolson implicit method. The heat equation is discretized in both time and space, and the resulting tridiagonal system is solved using the Thomas algorithm. The simulation explores the temperature distribution over time and space and compares it to the analytical solution.
