# Numerical Simulation of Heat Conduction using Crank-Nicolson Method
A numerical simulation of heat conduction using the Crank-Nicolson implicit method. The heat equation is discretized in both time and space, and the resulting tridiagonal system is solved using the Thomas algorithm. The code solves the heat equation numerically and compares the results with the analytical solution. The simulation is conducted over a specified number of time steps and spatial steps.
